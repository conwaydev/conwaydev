# ðŸ‘‹ Howdy! 

Iâ€™m a Chicago-based front-end developer currently working as an Engineering Manager at Sprout Social and Iâ€™m passionate about the web and pork. My pronouns are he/him/his. 

Iâ€™m interested in networking with developers who

* ðŸ“‰ Care about web performance and its business impact
* ðŸ“± Love to make the web accessible for everyone regardless of device, bandwidth, or ability
* ðŸ’¼ Want to talk about making tech a more inclusive industry regardless of demographic or experience
